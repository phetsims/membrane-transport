# PlayAreaSummary strings vary based on screen.
-playAreaSummaryIntro = An observation window zooms in on a cross-section of a cellâ€™s membrane. The membrane consists of a wiggling phospholipid bilayer, a double-layered sheet, that separates fluids inside and outside of cell. Added solute particles are suspended in fluid and randomly move with Brownian motion.

-playAreaSummarySolutes = You can choose from a list of solutes and add them to inside and outside.

-playAreaSummaryProteins = Transport proteins can be added directly to membrane.

-playAreaSummaryVoltagePotential = There are options to change membrane voltage potential and optionally hide visual charge labels.

-playAreaSummaryBarCharts = Solute bar charts provide a comparative summary for amount of each solute inside and outside membrane.

interactionHint = Add or remove solute to inside or outside of membrane.
interactionHintWithTransportProteins = Add or remove solutes to inside or outside of membrane, and play with transport channels.
