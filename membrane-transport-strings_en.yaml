                                          An observation window zooms in on a cross-section of a cell's membrane.
                                            The membrane consists of a wiggling phospholipid bilayer, a double-layered sheet
                                            that separates fluids inside and outside of cell. When added to outside or inside,
                                            solute particles are suspended in fluid and randomly move with Brownian motion.
    playAreaSummaryProteins:              Transport proteins of different types can be added directly to membrane.
    playAreaSummaryPotential:             There are options to change cell environment and affect added proteins.
    playAreaSummaryBarCharts:             Bar charts of solute concentrations dynamically compare solute amounts outside and inside cell.
