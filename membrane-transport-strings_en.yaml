    playArea:
      intro:       |-
                   An observation window zooms in on a cross-section of a cell's membrane.
                     The membrane consists of a wiggling phospholipid bilayer, a double-layered sheet
                     that separates fluids inside and outside of cell. When added to outside or inside,
                     solute particles are suspended in fluid and randomly move with Brownian motion.
      proteins:    Transport proteins of different types can be added directly to membrane.
      potential:   There are options to change cell environment and affect added proteins.
      barCharts:   Bar charts of solute concentrations dynamically compare solute amounts outside and inside cell.
