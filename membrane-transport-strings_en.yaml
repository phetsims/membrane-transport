    playArea:
      intro:       |-
                   An observation window zooms in on a cross-section of a cell's membrane.
                     The membrane consists of a wiggling phospholipid bilayer, a double-layered sheet
                     that separates fluids inside and outside of cell. When added to outside or inside,
                     solute particles are suspended in fluid and randomly move with Brownian motion.
      proteins:    Transport proteins of different types can be added directly to membrane.
      potential:   There are options to change cell environment and affect added proteins.
      barCharts:   Bar charts of solute concentrations dynamically compare solute amounts outside and inside cell.

                                    Sodium Potassium Pump begins open to the inside with 3 small circular binding sites awaiting solute. A phosphate is required to change the shape of the protein and open to the outside. Two larger circular binding sites awaiting solute are exposed. The pump returns to its original shape, open to the inside.
                                    Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter begins open to the outside with two small circular binding sites and one hexagonal binding site. Requires specific solute concentration outside cell to shuttle. Cotransporter changes shape to shuttle solutes to inside and returns to to original shape.
