# Membrane Transport Simulation - Model Description

This document describes the core concepts of the **Membrane Transport** simulation, designed for educators and students.
The simulation models how particles move across a cell membrane via membrane proteins: open channels, gated channels
(ligand-gated and voltage-gated), active transport pumps, and glucose transporters. Below, key terminology and biological
concepts are defined clearly, and the simulation’s behaviors, including channel gating and diffusion, are explained.

## Terminology

**Cell Membrane:** A semipermeable barrier (phospholipid bilayer) separating a cell’s interior from its exterior
environment. In the simulation, it’s depicted as a barrier dividing two fluid regions (inside/outside). Most substances
cross only via membrane proteins.

**Diffusion:** Passive movement of particles from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration due to
random particle motion. The simulation visualizes diffusion as random particle motion, resulting in net movement from
high to low concentrations.

**Concentration Gradient:** A difference in concentration between two areas. Particles naturally diffuse down their
concentration gradient (high to low concentration).

**Membrane Channel:** A protein forming a pore that allows specific substances to diffuse across the membrane. Channels
can be always open or gated (ligand-gated or voltage-gated). Each type has a distinctive icon in the simulation.

**Ligand:** A molecule that binds to specific protein sites, triggering changes like opening ligand-gated channels. In
the simulation, ligands are represented as key-like particles that attach to these channels.

**Voltage-Gated Channel:** Channels that open or close in response to electrical voltage differences across the
membrane. In the simulation, channels open once a specific voltage threshold (charge difference) is reached.

**Active Transport:** Movement of substances across a membrane against their concentration gradient, requiring energy (
ATP). The sodium-potassium pump is an example, actively moving Na⁺ and K⁺ ions against their gradients.

**Facilitated Diffusion:** Passive movement of substances down their concentration gradient, assisted by carrier
proteins. Glucose transporters are an example. The transporter enables glucose, which otherwise would not diffuse
easily, to cross the membrane passively.

**Steady-State:** A state where particle concentrations are equal on both membrane sides, resulting in no net diffusion.
Particles still move randomly across the membrane, but overall concentrations remain stable.

## Core Concepts Overview

The simulation emphasizes the cell membrane’s **selective permeability**, showing how cells use proteins (channels and
pumps) to control transport. Without these proteins, most particles (ions, large polar molecules) cannot cross the
membrane.

- **Passive Diffusion:** Particles naturally move down their concentration gradients through open channels, without
  energy input. Diffusion continues until steady-state is reached.
- **Active Transport:** Pumps use energy to move particles against their gradients, creating or maintaining
  concentration differences.

The simulation also demonstrates passive diffusion of small gases (O₂ and CO₂) directly through the membrane, without
requiring channel proteins, due to their small size and nonpolar nature.

### Channel Gating Mechanisms

- **Ligand-Gated Channels:** Open when a ligand binds to the channel. In the simulation, ligand binding instantly opens
  the channel, allowing ions to diffuse through. Removing the ligand closes the channel again, stopping diffusion.

- **Voltage-Gated Channels:** Respond to changes in electrical voltage across the membrane. When a certain threshold of
  charge difference is reached, these channels open automatically, allowing ions to flow until the voltage returns below
  the threshold.

### ATP-Driven Active Transport

The sodium-potassium pump actively moves Na⁺ and K⁺ against their concentration gradients, requiring ATP energy. This
mechanism allows cells to maintain gradients essential for functions like nerve signaling. In the simulation, students
can observe the pump actively creating or increasing gradients.

### Glucose Transporters (Facilitated Diffusion)

Glucose, a large polar molecule, cannot freely cross the membrane. In the simulation, glucose transporters assist
glucose in diffusing down its gradient, without energy expenditure. The transporters act as bidirectional carriers,
allowing glucose movement toward steady-state. The diffusion rate depends on the number of transporters present.

### Dynamic steady-state and Diffusion Rates

The simulation visually illustrates that diffusion rates depend on:

- **Gradient size:** Larger concentration differences increase diffusion speed.
- **Number of open channels:** More channels speed up diffusion.
- **Pump activity:** Pumps actively prevent steady-state by continuously moving particles against their gradients.

### Passive Diffusion of Gases

Oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) can passively diffuse directly across the membrane without channel proteins, moving
freely down their concentration gradients due to their small size and nonpolar nature. The simulation reflects this by
showing these gases crossing the membrane freely without channels.

### Simplified Conceptual Model

The simulation models channels as either fully open or fully closed, simplifying complex real-world mechanisms:

- **Ligand-Gated Channels:** Instant binding/unbinding of ligands.
- **Voltage-Gated Channels:** Channels open instantly once a certain voltage threshold is reached.

Particles randomly diffuse, visually representing the microscopic randomness driving diffusion.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

Students using the simulation should be able to:

- Understand selective permeability and identify particle movement through various channel types.
- Differentiate between passive (channels, facilitated diffusion) and active transport (pumps).
- Recognize that passive diffusion stops at steady-state unless actively maintained by pumps.
- Describe how ligand and voltage signals regulate channel activity.
- Explain how passive and active transport differ in energy requirements and direction relative to concentration
  gradients.

Assumptions and Simplifications:

- The simulation assumes idealized conditions, such as perfect channel opening/closing and instantaneous ligand binding.
- It does not account for complex cellular environments, interactions, or real-world kinetics.
- It does not include all possible transport mechanisms or cellular processes, allowing students to grasp fundamental principles without overwhelming complexity.
- Lipid Bilayer movement is suggested using slight oscillation of the membrane, but not modeled in detail.
- The simulation does not include the effects of temperature, pressure, or other environmental factors on diffusion rates.
- Scales of molecules and transport proteins are not to scale, as the simulation is designed for educational clarity rather than precise molecular representation.
